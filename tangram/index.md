[Tangram](https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram) is a flexible browser-based mapping engine, designed for real-time rendering of 2D and 3D maps from vector tiles. Built around [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, Tangram provides optional control over almost every aspect of the map-making process, including cartography, lighting, and geometry customization. To get started, follow this [walkthrough](walkthrough.md) to learn how to make a map with Tangram.

Map styles, data filters, labels, and even graphics card code can be defined in a human-readable and -writable plain-text [scene file](Scene-file.md), and a JavaScript API permits direct interactive control of the style. Changing the color is just the beginning; every Tangram map is a 3D scene, so you also can modify [lights](Lights-Overview.md) and [cameras](Cameras-Overview.md).

Tangram is designed to use vector data sources such as Mapzenâ€™s free [vector tile service](https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles), which is a tiled, hosted version of the OpenStreetMap database. Besides points and lines, these data sources contain metadata, which Tangram can use to [filter](Filters-Overview.md) the data and change drawing styles in real time.

All of these effects are possible thanks to [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). You can write graphics card programs, known as [shaders](Shaders-Overview.md), and even JavaScript to add interactivity, mix data sources, and control the design of your maps.

A variety of demos are available at https://mapzen.com/projects/tangram. Tangram is free and open source, is available for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. The [source code](https://github.com/tangrams) is open to view and modify, and contributions are welcomed.
