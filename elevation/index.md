Mapzen's elevation service is a free, open-source web API (and C++ library) that provides digital elevation model (DEM) data as the result of a query. The elevation service data has many applications when combined with other routing and naivgation data, including computing the steepness of edges or generating an elevation profile along a route. This page documents the inputs and outputs to the service.
